This directory contains the sources for the PatBang interpreter and typechecker.  It should work correctly on any machine with ghc 7.6.1 or newer and a recent version of cabal-dev.  Once cabal-dev is installed, the Makefile will trigger the download and compilation of all dependencies from Hackage.

Once compilation is complete, the interpreter/typechecker can be found at

    dist/build/pat-bang/pat-bang
    
Similarly, the binary which executes the PatBang unit tests can be found at

    dist/build/tests/tests
