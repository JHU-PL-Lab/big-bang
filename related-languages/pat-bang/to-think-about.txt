* non-contractive types are forbidden in the implementation; why aren't non-contractive patterns a problem?
* according to the spec, a pattern which binds too few arguments simply doesn't match instead of failing application compatibility; is this good?
* specification of compatibility needs a failure case for when a pattern can't be projected from Î±2 and for when the argument list doesn't match the length of the parameter list
* substitution notation for compatibility is a little odd since pattern variables can repeat themselves; what about shadowing/overlap?
