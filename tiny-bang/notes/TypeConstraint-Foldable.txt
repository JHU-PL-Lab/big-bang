The Language.TinyBang.TypeSystem.Relations.Contours module has enabled
OverlappingInstaces to suppress a type error.  Haskell does not typecheck
ContourExtractable otherwise; the Foldable and TypeConstraint instances
would overlap in the presence of a Foldable instance for TypeConstraint.
TypeConstraint should therefore not have a Foldable instance (or should
have an instance such that both ContourExtractable instances behave like
each other).
