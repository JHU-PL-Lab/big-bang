The Language.TinyBang.TypeSystem.Relations.Contours submodules have enabled
OverlappingInstaces to suppress type errors.  Haskell does not typecheck
ContourExtractable (for instance) otherwise; the Foldable and TypeConstraint
instances would overlap in the presence of a Foldable instance for
TypeConstraint.  Similar facts hold true for e.g. Functor and
ContourInstantiable.  TypeConstraint should therefore not have these instances
(or should have an instance such that both instances behave the same).
